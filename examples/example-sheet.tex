\maketitle

\ex In the first task we want to show some very nice results.
\subex Let $T$ be a really difficult task and $s\in\Omega$ a helpless student. Then, $s$ cannot solve $T$ easily.
\begin{proof}
The proof is standard.
\end{proof}

\subex Some long and boring definitions\dots
\begin{proof}
\blindtext
\end{proof}

\exercise{Important Conjecture}
Let $A$ be from some set $M$ with very special properties. If we assume that some more magic assumptions hold, then we can show that indeed $A$ is pretty cool.
\begin{proof}
\blindtext
\end{proof}

\exercise{Exercise without proof}
Maybe we have an exercise where using a \verb+proof+ environment might seem odd. In cases like this, we simply don't use it and add some more \verb+\blindtext+ instead\dots
